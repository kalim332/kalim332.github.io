    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <div id="list1"><li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li></div>
        <div id="list1"><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li></div>
        <div id="list1"><li>¼ teaspoon salt</li></div>
        <div id="list1"><li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li></div>
        <div id="list1"><li>1¼ cups milk</li></div>
        <div id="list1"><li>5 eggs</li></div>
        <div id="list1"><li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li></div>
        <div id="list1"><li>8 slices of bacon</li></div>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
   
    <p>Yields dinner for two: 8 pancakes, 4 eggs, and 8 slices of bacon</p>
    
    <ol>
        <div id="list2"><li>To make the pancakes, in a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, one egg, and melted butter; stir until combined. Leave some lumps in the batter and don't overmix as the pancakes will not rise.
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>Set the batter aside, and start preparing your bacon. 
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>In a cold pan, arrange the bacon slices in a single layer. Don't let them overlap too much as they will not cook evenly. Heat the pan to medium heat and start cooking the bacon. Turn the pieces often to promote even browning. Keep flipping each slice until they reach your desired doneness (about 8-15 minutes.)
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>Remove the bacon from the pan and leave it to drain on some paper towels.
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>Pour out some of the bacon grease from the pan leaving just enough to lightly coat the bottom. This will be used to fry up the eggs.
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>Turn the pan to medium heat and individually crack the eggs into the pan. Cover the eggs with a lid and leave them to cook until the white is firm but the yolk is still runny (about 3-4 minutes.)
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>While you wait for the eggs to cook, start frying up the pancakes. 
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>Heat a lightly greased non-stick pan to medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the pancake batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes and then flip each pancake. Allow them to continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown.
        </li></div>
        <div id="list2"><li>Assemble the meal by plating the pancakes, bacon, and eggs. Serve with maple syrup, butter, salt, and pepper to taste.
        </li></div>
    </ol>
