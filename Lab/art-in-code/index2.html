                <h4><a href="https://jamesturrell.com/">Biography</a></h4>
                For over half a century, the American artist James Turrell has worked directly with light and space to create artworks that engage viewers with the limits and wonder of human perception. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Informed by his training in perceptual psychology and a childhood fascination with light, Turrell began experimenting with light as a medium in southern California in the mid-1960's. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Turrell often cites the Parable of Plato's Cave to introduce the notion that we are living in a reality of our own creation, subject to our human sensory limitations as well as contextual and cultural norms. The simple act of witnessing the sky from within a Turrell Skyspace, notably at dawn and dusk, reveals how we internally create the colors we see and thus, our perceived reality.
                <br>
                <br>
                Turrell's medium is pure light. He says, “My work has no object, no image and no focus. With no object, no image and no focus, what are you looking at? You are looking at you looking. What is important to me is to create an experience of wordless thought.”

                <h5><a href="http://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/turrell/">Aten Reign</a></h5>
                For his exhibition at the Guggenheim, Turrell has created a major new installation entitled Aten Reign (2013), radically transforming the museum in the tradition of his most sweeping, large-scale projects.  
                <br>
                <br>
                In Aten Reign, daylight from the museum's oculus streams down to light the deepest layer of a massive assembly suspended from the ceiling. Using a series of interlocking cones lined with LED fixtures, the installation surrounds this core of daylight with five elliptical rings of shifting, colored light that echo the banded pattern of the museum's ramps. As is typical of Turrell's work, the apparatus that creates the effect is mostly hidden from view, encouraging viewers to interpret what they see by means of their own perception. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The work promotes a state of meditative contemplation in a communal viewing space, rekindling the museum's founding identity as a “temple of spirit,” as articulated by Hilla Rebay, the Guggenheim's first director and a pioneer in the promotion of nonobjective art.
